== Migrate Sock-Shop Application

ACME Corporation is in the process of upgrading the production environment of their online socks store from OCP 3 to OCP 4. The application consists of various micro-services, and uses a shared NFS cluster for storage. ACME has already installed the OCP 4 cluster, and you have been asked to migrate the Socks-Shop application from their OCP 3 environment.

The application and all of its resources are contained within the `sock-shop` namespace.

Rather than provide a step-by-step walkthrough as we have in the previous two labs, you’ll be on your own for this round.

The high-level steps are as follows:

[arabic]
. Launch the MTC WebUI.
. Add a new Migration Plan (name it `socks-shop-mig-plan`).
. Use Move ('swing' the PV) for each of the four persistent volumes as the transfer option;
. Execute a `Migration` of the Plan.
. Verify the application is functioning on the destination cluster.

Next, we’ve added a lab covering multi-namespace migrations using the API directly for large scale operations.
